		<p class="left">Basketball was invented by James Naismith in 1891. Naismith lived in Springfield, Massachusetts at the time. He invented this game so that kids would have something to play between the football and baseball seasons. Basketball started with throwing a soccer ball into a peach basket. Eventually, players realized it was easier to get the ball back by cutting a hole at the bottom of the basket. This turned into a hoop. Nets, rims, and backboards were introduced a little over a decade later and the game evolved to where it is today!</p>
		<p class="left">The first professional league was founded in 1898, called the National Basketball League. In 1946, the Basketball Association of America was founded. The name was changed to the National Basketball Association(NBA) after merging with the National Basketball League(NBL) in 1949. This is the league that is the most popular in the world today, showcasing the best basketball players in the world.</p>
